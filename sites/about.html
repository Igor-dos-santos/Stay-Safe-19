          <p class= "aboutP">By the age of 25 Igor was already a success in the music Industry. He decided
            to give up his career in order to become a genius developer. His unprecedented coding skills
            are compared only to his great compositions in music. In the second year of college he had already mastered
            over 20 programming languages and decided to write his own so he could work in secrecy while developing his new
            Social Media Platform. He then used his experience and diligence to help his partners build up Stay-Safe19 company
            which rendered him and his partners millions of Euros. Now the entire world awaits for his next big project. Some say he is the creator
            of Bitcoin and also the famous artist Banksy. No one knows for sure.    </p>

          <p class= "aboutP">&ensp;After graduating from Harward, Tamara completed her Masters degree in Software Engineering at NCI. She joined SAFE-19 with the idea of
            integrating cloud functionality into the infrastructures of the company, but the truth is that she is a lazy bitch.
            She never stops asking for days off because she loves traveling so much. She likes hiking in Wicklow mountains even during winter and 
            under extreme Irish weather.
            With a strong experience in IT and backend development, Tamara finally has the life that she wants. She spends loads of time creating useless experimental web apps.

            <br>
            &ensp;Be like Tamara, be lazy and free.
